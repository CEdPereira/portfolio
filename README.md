Welcome to my Cybersecurity Projects Portfolio! Here, I showcase projects that I've been involved in to develop the hard skills necessary to contribute to the cybersecurity field.

Projects

1. File permissions in Linux

■ A group of researchers share a common directory that requires specific permissions for users, groups and others. The analyst job was to check the permissions for all files in the directory, including any hidden files, to make sure that permissions align with clearance. All permissions must match clearance to minimize risks, otherwise they were changed to meet demands.  

■ Modeling and Evaluation: Name and describe the models you used for the project and any corresponding evaluation metrics.  
■ Conclusion: Your recommendations for solving the problem and a description of any future steps you want to take to expand on your project.
